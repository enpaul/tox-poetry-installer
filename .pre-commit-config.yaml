# All of the pre-commit hooks here actually use the `pytyhon` pre-commit language
# setting. However, for the python language setting, pre-commit will create and manage
# a cached virtual environment for each hook ID and do a bare `pip install <repo>` into
# the venv to setup the hook. This can result in conflicting dependency versions between
# the version installed to the pre-commit venv and the version installed to the Poetry
# venv specified in the lockfile.
#
# The solution is to specify `language: system` for all hooks and then install the
# required dependencies to the Poetry venv. The `system` language skips the isolated
# venv creation and looks for the entrypoint specified by the hook in the global
# environment which, if running in the Poetry venv, will find the entrypoint provided
# by the Poetry-managed dependency.
